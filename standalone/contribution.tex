\vspace{1.5cm}

%The work was done by me, with contributions from me and help from myself when I couldn't do it alone.

The work presented in this thesis was realised in the computational astrophysics research group at the Astronomy Department of Stockholm University.

The initial simulations, from core collapse, were setup and performed by Evan O'Connor. The long-term simulations, from time of mapping, presented in this work were setup and ran by the author. All the simulations were realised using the \flash\ code \citep{Fryxell2000}. The long-term simulations were realised using a version of \flash\ modified by the author, who implemented a new outflow boundary condition into the code. The inflow boundary condition was already present in the code, but was modified by the author to integrate it in conjunction with the outflow condition. The simulations ran by the author were realised using \(\sim 19,000\) core-hours on the supercomputer \emph{Tetralith}\footnote{\url{https://www.nsc.liu.se/systems/tetralith/}}.

Tools and pipelines for the analysis were developed by the author, with help from Evan O'Connor, Haakon Andresen and Oliver Eggenberger Andersen.

# Master Thesis

&nbsp;&nbsp; *"We now grant you the rank of Master."*

---

This the latex project for my Master Thesis entitled "Long-Term Simulations of Core-Collapse Supernovae with a Neutron Star Central Engine" (pretty long title, innit?)

This thesis was realised at the Astronomy Department of Stockholm University under supervision of Prof. Evan Patrick O'Connor. It was defended 28 August 2024, and was awarded an **A**.

The main file is main.tex (doi) and every chapter and specific sections (ToC, Abstract, Front page, etc.) is contained either in the "chapters" or "standalone" directory.
